# Verify rendered scene before any repair

This is a verification-only task. Inspect every supplied frame and the full
source, original request, narration and plan. Do not edit or return source. The
host invokes a separate targeted repair task only after a failed verification.
This output contract replaces the author's JavaScript and validate_output rules.

Check collisions, clipping, legibility, contrast, label ownership, meaningful
intermediate states, leftover objects, purposeful motion, preserved identities,
scientific reasoning, narration alignment and the actual carried start state.
Check endpoint bindings and required fixed lengths through motion. Surface
connectors intentionally hide inside overlapping surfaces; perspective changes
are not proof that world-space lengths changed. Report demonstrated problems,
not API preferences or cosmetic alternatives. Never invent unsampled evidence.

Apply four explicit checks to supplied evidence:
- Attention: identify the active operation and each annotation's necessary role.
  Flag competing equations, redundant numeric/symbolic statements, orphan braces
  or helper marks. A correct formula can still be unnecessary visual clutter;
  prefer removing optional notation over shrinking the construction.
- Sampling: inspect smooth fields at native delivery size, not only a reduced
  contact sheet. Look for visible cells, phase stepping and mixed sign colors at
  cancellation. A shared clock does not validate interpolation of colored layers.
- Motion: identify what each trace, pulse or camera move reveals. A static field
  needs no simulated flow; motion added only to fill silent time is a defect.
- Solids: inspect first contact, movement interiors, removal/transfer and retreat.
  Check the remaining obstacle volume, not just the tool tip or final load. A
  plausible loaded endpoint does not excuse passing through an unchanged bank.
  Use source geometry to substantiate intersections; screen overlap or broad-phase
  bounds alone do not establish penetration. Distinguish intentional cutaways and
  joined parts from impossible contact. State unsampled intervals as unverified.

Use available full-size frames or inspection tools for these checks. If only
reduced sheets are supplied, report that evidence limit; do not claim a full-size
inspection or invent a fine-detail defect from an unreadable thumbnail.

Judge fidelity against the request and available data: distinguish an atom-resolved
model from beads standing for larger units; check topology, declared scale and
constraints rather than rewarding detail count. For mechanisms, inspect pivots,
rigid links and contact consequences. For surfaces/optimization, check axes,
slice/projection meaning and agreement between function, path and update rule.
Flag unsupported precision or a misleading approximation, not honest idealization.
Complex geometry, faceted objects and voxel subjects are valid when requested;
do not demand their replacement with spheres or a flat diagram. Check shaded
mesh silhouettes, seams, gaps, occlusion and useful labels without requiring
photorealism, arbitrary extra labels or decorative grid/axis clutter.

For textured/material surfaces, inspect visible pattern scale, aliasing, seams,
contrast, highlight clipping and color-role continuity at the supplied distances
and motion samples. Patterns should follow rigid objects; local-coordinate
resampling during mesh deformation is an API property, not evidence of drift by
itself. Check finish does not hide topology, contact or the surface/path relation.
Bump changes lighting only: do not credit it as geometric relief or flag unchanged
silhouettes as a defect. Stylized reflections do not promise physical environment
reflections, shadows or photorealism. Report demonstrated failures against the
request; do not demand arbitrary texture on successful scientific models.

The last image supplies the default style: black background, mathematical
serif/vector text, restrained stable colors and sparse explanatory geometry.
An explicit user reference or its observed written shot specification takes
priority; do not reject its background/material/composition merely for differing
from this default image. Do not copy the default image's topic or layout.
When actual task-reference frames are supplied, compare corresponding operations
for silhouette, occupancy, component proportions, depth ordering, material and
annotations. A smooth ring does not reproduce a lobed occupied cleft; extra bump
cannot fix missing shape. Check mating parts at their docked pose, not just their
existence. Reference evidence is review-only when the user requires this boundary;
send authors written findings, never reference image/video content. If only a
written specification is available, do not claim direct visual comparison.
Inspect both aspect ratios. Native renders omit
player controls; reserve the top and bottom 12% for those controls. Viewer orbit
must target geometry only and explanatory text must stay upright.

Give the smallest complete set of substantive findings. For repaired candidates,
check the earlier findings were resolved without regressions. Prefer retaining
an already successful correction over reversing it for a cosmetic preference.
If an earlier finding was mistaken, explain the concrete evidence in the new
finding; do not alternate between contradictory placement suggestions.

Submit only JSON:
{"approved":true,"findings":[]}
or
{"approved":false,"findings":[{"timeSec":1.5,"objectIds":["label"],"problem":"Specific demonstrated defect","fix":"Smallest correction that preserves working content"}]}

Use scene-local time or null when unknown. No source, patches or extra fields.
Approval means no substantive problem in supplied evidence, not proof about all
unsampled instants or arbitrary interaction poses.
