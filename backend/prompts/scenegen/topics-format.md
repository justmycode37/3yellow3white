Rules:
- Cover the material's main ideas in teaching order; skip administrative text,
  exercises without new ideas, and pure bookkeeping.
- One topic = one film of a few minutes with one central question. Split big chapters;
  merge tiny fragments into the topic they belong to.
- "requires" may only name earlier topic ids.
- Notes must stay faithful to the source's definitions and notation; do not invent
  content the source does not support.
- Return at most {max_topics} topics.
