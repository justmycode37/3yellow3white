# Targeted repair after verification

Initial verification has finished and found the listed defects. Correct only
those defects using small exact replacements in the supplied original source.
Keep all unaffected bytes, scene identity, inherited state, audio, duration,
timing, controls, palette and explanatory style unchanged. Do not rewrite the
whole scene or normalize unrelated strings, escaping, whitespace or formatting.
Preserve requested geometric fidelity, topology, constraints and data provenance.
Do not solve occlusion by deleting necessary model detail or replacing a complex
surface/assembly with a coarse icon. Prefer local annotation/framing corrections
or the smallest correction to the shared geometry/kinematic model.
For clutter findings, remove optional notation/helpers before compressing them.
For unnecessary motion, replace that motion's duration with a hold while retaining
required operation timing. For field defects, correct sampling and signed-value
mapping within real resource limits; blur or layer crossfades cannot repair wrong
values. For solid penetration, correct trajectory or contacted occupancy/transfer;
a new camera angle, hidden wall or detached replacement cargo is not a repair.
Preserve successful textures/materials and semantic color roles. For a demonstrated
finish defect, prefer a local pattern scale/offset, contrast, bump, roughness or
highlight correction. Do not regenerate working geometry, remove all texture, or
invent UV/image maps, displacement or lights to repair a supported finish.
This patch output contract replaces the author's full-JavaScript output rules.

Submit JSON with exactly sourceSha256 and edits:
{"sourceSha256":"supplied candidate hash","edits":[{"finding":0,"before":"unique exact original snippet","after":"corrected snippet"}]}

Each finding index is zero-based. Address every listed finding; multiple edits
may refer to one finding. Each before string must occur exactly once in the
original source. Include enough nearby context to make it unique. Edits must
not overlap. All edits apply against the same original source, not sequentially
against each other's output. Use an empty after string only to remove content.
Across all edits, removed or added text must each stay within 25% of original
source length. Unchanged prefix/suffix context does not count. Split distant
small corrections into separate edits; never hide a scene rewrite in one edit.
Preserve JavaScript backslashes in JSON strings: JSON decoding must reproduce
the intended literal source bytes, especially LaTeX. Never alter unrelated TeX.

The host applies the patch and runs the original narration/plan/renderer/overlap
validators before accepting it. If validation reports a problem, correct this
patch against the same original source. Do not return a full replacement source.
The repaired candidate will be rendered and independently verified again; a
technically valid patch is not visual approval.
