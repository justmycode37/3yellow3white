Explain why a positive test need not mean the condition is likely. Use a hypothetical population of 1,000: 10 have the condition; the test is positive for 9 of them and for 99 of the 990 without it. Derive the positive-test probability of actually having the condition, then explain how changing prevalence while keeping sensitivity and false-positive rate fixed changes the result. Include one brief thinking pause. This is a toy probability example, not medical guidance.', videoMode: 'classic' },
  { id: 'leaf', title: 'A leaf trades water for carbon', topic: 'Write a roughly 2-minute lesson in exactly 3 scenes for a curious 12-year-old. Explain how opening stomata lets carbon dioxide enter for photosynthesis while water vapor escapes, and why closing them in dry conditions protects water but restricts carbon uptake. Show the causal tradeoff rather than list plant parts. No equations and no scripted pauses. Do not imply plants consciously decide, that stomata are one-way valves, or that closing instantly stops all water loss.', videoMode: 'classic' },
  { id: 'protocol', title: 'Why retrying can charge twice', topic: 'Write a roughly 3-minute lesson in exactly 4 scenes for junior developers. Explain idempotency keys using a payment request whose response is lost after the server commits it. Include the case where the first request never arrived, show why timeout alone cannot distinguish these cases, and explain how an atomic stored key/result association makes a retry return the prior result instead of repeating the operation. Distinguish retrying the same intended purchase from a new purchase; state that key reuse must reject a changed payload, and that retention scope limits the guarantee. No pauses. A request/response diagram is appropriate; no equations needed.', videoMode: 'classic' },

Begin with the definitions of pointwise and uniform convergence, then make the quantifier difference meaningful using f_n(x)=x^n on [0,1] and on [0,a] for fixed 0<a<1. Explain why taking n large for each fixed x does not give one n for every x, and why the restricted interval fixes this. A plot may support the argument but must not stand in for it. Include one reachable prediction and one brief pause. Preserve the endpoint x=1 and the distinction between pointwise limit and uniform error.', videoMode: 'classic' },
